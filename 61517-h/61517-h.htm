<span class="i0">Lived with a little girl called Betsey-Jane,</span>
<span class="i0">He was her oldest friend, thin was his hair,</span>
<span class="i0">One arm he lacked, but Jocko did not care,</span>
<span class="i0">No more did Betsey-Jane;—his eyes were gone,</span>
<span class="i0">His figure flat, but all his teeth were on,</span>
<span class="i0">Stitched to his mouth, a row of beady pearls</span>
<span class="i0">More white than those of many little girls.</span>
<span class="i0">All day to please he did his docile best</span>
<span class="i0">And only squeaked when Betsey punched his chest;</span>
<span class="i0">When bed-time came and Nurse tucked Betsey in,</span>

<span class="i0">She’d learnt to talk, but not learnt when to stop,</span>
<span class="i0">Her yellow hair swung round her in a mop,</span>
<span class="i0">Round was her face, her eyes were opened wide</span>
<span class="i0">And only blinked in sleep or when she cried;</span>
<span class="i0">White frocks she had and blue her pinafore</span>
<span class="i0">With scarlet stitching at the neck, and more</span>
<span class="i0">Delights she had than many girls and boys,—</span>
<span class="i0">Father and Mother, Nurse and many toys</span>
<span class="i0">To comfort her, but, more than all the rest,</span>
<span class="i0">There is no doubt she loved her Jocko best.</span>

<span class="i0">A cat approached the cushion where he lay</span>
<span class="i0">And tore away his inoffensive hair</span>
<span class="i0">And left him with his leathern skin laid bare,</span>
<span class="i0">Silent upon the rug. His Betsey-Jane</span>
<span class="i0">Found him with tears and kissed him well again;</span>
<span class="i0">But she herself, forgetful of her grief,</span>
<span class="i0">Laughed when they dressed him in a handkerchief</span>

<span class="i0">One day he sat, as docile as a lamb,</span>

<span class="i0">Refused to sleep and went from bad to worse,</span>

<span class="i0">The burly drovers elbowed him aside,</span>

<span class="i0">Behind their hurdles, and the hairy eyes</span>
<span class="i0">Of families of little porkers stared</span>
<span class="i0">And cart-horses with braided tresses glared</span>
<span class="i0">And stamped upon the cobbles. From their shed</span>
